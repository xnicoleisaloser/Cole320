### Hi there! I'm Coal.

I make dumb and bad code, that's usually interpreted.

Some things I'm interested in:

- Wasting time
- Reverse Engineering
- Esoteric projects
- Ricing
- Using fonts that support ligatures

***I'm always happy to review pull requests for any of my projects, if you'd like to help out!***

Before you go, you should check out my website [CoalFarm](http://coalfarm.cf)!
It's most likely blank at the moment, but I'll be sure to add to it soon!

**Hot take: Light theme is cringe.**
